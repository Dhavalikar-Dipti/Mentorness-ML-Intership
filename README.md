## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Understanding Weak Learners in AdaBoost**
- **Objective:** Create a short and engaging reel explaining weak learners in the AdaBoost algorithm.
- **Description:** 
  - A weak learner is a model that performs slightly better than random guessing (accuracy > 50% for binary classification). 
  - In AdaBoost, multiple weak learners are combined iteratively to form a strong learner with significantly improved accuracy.
- **Output:** A video reel explaining the concept with visuals and examples.

### **2. Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning**
- **Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict salaries based on given features.
- **Steps:**
  1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, feature encoding).
  2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
  3. Model building using regression techniques such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
  4. Evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ².
- **Output:** A trained model capable of predicting salaries based on input features.

### **3. Credit Card Approval Prediction**
- **Objective:** Predict whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected using machine learning.
- **Steps:**
  1. Data preprocessing, including:
     - Encoding categorical variables.
     - Handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE (if applicable).
  2. Feature selection to identify the most significant predictors.
  3. Model building using classification algorithms such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Decision Trees
  4. Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **Output:** A model that predicts credit card application outcomes with high accuracy.
